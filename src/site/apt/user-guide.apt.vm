User guide

  To make use of this library you must run at least Java #property("maven.compiler.target").

  This site will guide you through the components of this library:

  [[1]] {{{./dircontextsource.html}<<<DirContextSource>>>}}: the main component
        itself for creating a <<<DirContext>>> object with the ease of a builder.

  [[2]] {{{./dircontextsourcefactory.html}<<<DirContextSourceFactory>>>}}:
        a factory which wraps the builder behind the context source and makes it
        available as a resource to servlet containers in a standard fashion.
