Using DirContextSource

  This user guide is comprised of two examples of the <<<DirContextSource>>> and
  also several notes on authentication and logging.

    Contents:

%{toc|fromDepth=2}

* Basic example

  In few lines you have a usable <<<DirContextSource>>>:

+----------------------------
import net.sf.michaelo.dirctxsrc.DirContextSource;
import javax.naming.directory.DirContext;
[$ellipsis]
DirContextSource.Builder builder = new DirContextSource.Builder("ldap://hostname");
DirContextSource contextSource = builder.build();
// try and catch block omitted for the sake of brevity,
// handle NamingException appropriately
DirContext context = contextSource.getDirContext();
// Perform operations
context.close();
[$ellipsis]
+----------------------------

* Advanced example

  A more complex example includes several configuration options as described in
  the builder's {{{./apidocs/net/sf/michaelo/dirctxsrc/DirContextSource.Builder.html}JavaDoc}}:

+----------------------------
import net.sf.michaelo.dirctxsrc.DirContextSource;
import javax.naming.directory.DirContext;
[$ellipsis]
// Use several hostnames in the case if one fails
DirContextSource.Builder builder = new DirContextSource.Builder("ldap://hostname",
                                 "ldap://hostname2", "ldap://distant-hostname");
// I'd like to see all comm on System.err
builder.debug();
// Hosts are unreliable, so keep trying
builder.retries(5).retryWait(5000);

DirContextSource contextSource = builder.build();
// try and catch block omitted for the sake of brevity,
// handle NamingException appropriately
DirContext context = contextSource.getDirContext();
// Perform operations
context.close();
[$ellipsis]
+----------------------------

* Authentication

  The <<<DirContextSource>>> supports two types of authentication mechanisms,
  none/anonymous and GSS-API with Kerberos 5.

    [Note] Other mechanisms are not directly supported because I never needed
           them. If you need any, please file a {{{./issue-tracking.html}ticket}}.

  * <Anonymous> auth: works out of the box, the builder is configured for this
    mechanism by default.

  * <GSS-API (Kerberos 5)> auth: requires a bit more work. Make sure that JVM is
    properly configured for Kerberos and add the following to the basic example
    builder:

+--------------
[$ellipsis]
builder.gssApiAuth();
[$ellipsis]
+--------------

    The above example presumes that you have configured your JAAS login file with
    the default login entry name <<<DirContentSource>>>. If you prefer an alternative
    name configure as follows:

+--------------
[$ellipsis]
builder.gssApiAuth("MyAlternativeName");
[$ellipsis]
+--------------

  There are a few more options for this authentication mechanism, like mutual auth
  or auth integrity and/or privacy protection. See the builder's {{{./apidocs/net/sf/michaelo/dirctxsrc/DirContextSource.Builder.html}JavaDoc}}
  for more details.

* Logging

  This library was primarily created to be used within Apache Tomcat. More
  precisely, in Tomcat's server class path. I wanted to keep the dependency
  footprint as low as possible, therefore I have decided to use JUL for logging
  purposes although I strongly prefer SLF4J. If you happen to use this library
  not in the described environment, add the <<<jul-to-slf4j>>> artifact to your
  class path and use SLF4J exclusively.
